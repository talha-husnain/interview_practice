# Word Encoder

This code takes a text file containing words and encodes them into a sequence of instructions that can be used to navigate a 6x5 matrix of the alphabet. The matrix is arranged as follows:

```
A B C D E
F G H I J
K L M N O
P Q R S T
U V W X Y
Z
```

Each word is encoded by following these steps:

1. Find the position of the first letter of the word in the matrix.
2. Move vertically to the row of the next letter.
3. Move horizontally to the column of the next letter.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each letter in the word.
5. Add a '#' character to the end of the sequence to indicate the end of the word.

For example, the word "UP" would be encoded as "d#r#".

The code uses a function called `find_position_of_letter` to find the position of a letter in the matrix. This function takes two arguments: the letter to be found and the alphabet matrix. It returns a tuple containing the row and column indices of the letter.

The code then uses a function called `encode_word` to encode a word into a sequence of instructions. This function takes two arguments: the word to be encoded and the alphabet matrix. It returns a string containing the encoded instructions.

The code then uses a function called `process_file` to read a text file containing words and encode each word into a sequence of instructions. This function takes one argument: the file path of the text file. It prints the encoded instructions for each word to the console.

The code is structured as follows:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import sys

# Define the alphabet matrix
alphabet = [list("ABCDE"), list("FGHIJ"), list("KLMNO"), list(
    "PQRST"), list("UVWXY"), ["Z", '', '', '', '']]

# Define the function to find the position of a letter in the matrix
def find_position_of_letter(letter, alphabet):
    for index, row in enumerate(alphabet):
        if letter in row:
            return index, row.index(letter)
    return None  # Just as a precaution, but this case shouldn't occur

# Define the function to encode a word into a sequence of instructions
def encode_
